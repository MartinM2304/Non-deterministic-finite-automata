# Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) Project ðŸ”€
This repository contains a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) implementation in C++, created as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The project focuses on demonstrating my ability to design and build custom data structures and algorithms from scratch, without relying on the Standard Template Library (STL).

ðŸ“– About the Project\
A Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is a computational model used in theoretical computer science to recognize patterns or formal languages. NFAs are a cornerstone of automata theory, and this project brings the theory to life through an object-oriented implementation in C++.
The project emphasizes low-level programming by implementing custom data structures such as vectors, sets and strings, showcasing mastery over fundamental concepts and algorithms without external libraries.

ðŸ›  Key Features\
Custom Data Structures: Fully implemented core structures, such as:
A dynamic array (Vector)
A key-value store (Map)
A string class (String)
State Management: Define and manage states, including initial and accepting states.
Transition Functions: Handle state transitions, including epsilon (Îµ) transitions.
String Validation: Verify whether a given input string is accepted by the automaton.
NFA Logic Implementation: Algorithms for epsilon-closure, state traversal, and language recognition.
Object-Oriented Principles: Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism used to model NFA behavior.

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned\
This project enhanced my understanding of:

Manual Implementation of Data Structures: Building foundational tools like vectors, maps, and strings without relying on STL.
Automata Theory: Understanding NFA behavior, including state transitions and epsilon-closures.
Algorithm Design: Developing algorithms for traversal, language validation, and error handling.
Object-Oriented Programming: Encapsulating state and transition logic into a reusable and extendable class structure.
Low-Level Debugging: Troubleshooting and optimizing manually implemented data structures.
